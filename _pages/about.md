Hi, I'm Brian Ng, a Cognitive Science sophmore who's from Hong Kong! I dabble with a lot of different interests, but my main focuses (foci?) for now are UI/UX Design, Front-end Development and 3D Modeling. I also do visual art whenever I find the time, and currently I'm learning Blender to fully explore digital art as a medium (turns out it's really handy).

Not only am I interested in design and art-related stuff, I'm also interested in game design, e-sports, basketball, and books! Feel free to contact me through my [email](mailto:ngbrianyc@gmail.com) or my [insta](instagram.com/ngbrianyc)

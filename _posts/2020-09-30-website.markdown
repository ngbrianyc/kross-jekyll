I had been asked to create a personal website for Dr. Edward Minchin, a professor at the University of Florida. I used Jekyll to create a simple static website, and used HTML, CSS and Markdown to customize the website. At first, I was under the impression that Professor Minchin requested an academic-styled website, and hence I customized the Minimal Mistakes Jekyll layout to create an accessible, professional-looking website. However, as I started to develop the site, I realized that Professor Minchin was intending to use it as his personal website, so I am now currently iterating through several designs to create a more personalized look for him.
